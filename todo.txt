==== REQUIRED FUNCTIONS IN pfa.c ====


-> double optionPrice(Option* option);

option: a pointer to a structure, this structure defines the type Option 
(using typedef). It contains all the parameters of an option.

Returns the price of an option in euros.

-> double clientCDF_S(InsuredClient* client, double x);

client: a pointer to a structure which defines the type InsuredClient. 
It contains all the parameters of a customer of an insurance company.

Returns the value at x the cumulative distribution function of the random
variable: 
    S = "Sum of the reimbursements from the insurance company to this customer,
    this year"


-> bool init_integration(char* quadrature, double dt)

quadrature: a character string, the name of the quadrature formula to be used. 
Its possible values are "left", "right", "middle", "trapezes", "simpson", 
"gauss2" or "gauss3".
dt: a positive number specifying the subdivisions length.

Returns true if everything happened well. 
Otherwise, it returns false (for example, unknown quadrature formula, 
or negative value of dt).


-> double phi(double x);
-> double PHI(double x); 
See specifications PDF for both.


==== REQUIRED FUNCTIONS IN integration.c ====


-> bool setQuadFormula(QuadFormula* qf, char* name); 
Affects the fields of qf to the values corresponding to the quadrature formula 
specified by name.

qf: a pointer to the object of type QuadFormula which will be updated.
name: the name of the quadrature formula. Possible values are "left", "right", 
"middle", "trapezes", "simpson", "gauss2" or "gauss3"

Returns true  if everything happened well. Otherwise, it returns false 
(e.g:if the name of the quadrature formula, given in argument name, is unknown).


-> double integrate(double (*f)(double), double a, double b, int N, QuadFormula* qf);
returns a numerical approximation of integral from a to b of f(t)dt.

f: a function pointer, pointing to the function that will be integrated.
a and b: bounds of the integration interval.
N: number of subdivisions. The interval [a, b] is split in N subdivisions 
[ai, bi], then the the quadrature formula is used to approximate the integral of 
f sur on each subdivision.
qf: the quadrature formula that will be used.

Returns the numerical approximation of the integral.


-> double integrate_dx(double (*f)(double), double a, double b, double dx, 
                        QuadFormula* qf);

f: a function pointer, pointing to the function that will be integrated.
a and b: bounds of the integration interval
dx: length of the subdivisions. The interval [a, b] is split in N subdivisions 
[ai, bi]. N is computed such that the length of each subdivision, 
(bi − ai) = (b − a)/N, is the closest as possible to dx (maybe not equal, 
because N has to be an integer).
qf: the quadrature formula that will be used.

Returns the numerical approximation of the integral.
